# Roblox DBZ Game Framework

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive framework for a Roblox-based Dragon Ball Z game, designed with modularity and scalability in mind. The framework is written in Luau, Roblox’s scripting language, and offers a robust API for developers to manage game systems, character interactions, and gameplay mechanics.

The primary focus of this project is to provide developers with a foundation to build an immersive and feature-rich game, leveraging pre-built modules for rendering, combat, input handling, and more.

## Features

- Modular Architecture: Each system is encapsulated in its own module for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Customizable Systems: Includes modules for camera management, combat mechanics, NPC behavior, and more.
- Developer-Friendly: Well-documented API and examples for integrating custom features.
- Optimized Performance: Designed with efficiency and scalability in mind to handle complex game scenarios.
